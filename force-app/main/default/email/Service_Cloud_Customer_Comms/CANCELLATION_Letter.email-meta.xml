TripADeal can not itemise the cost of each individual component as it was sold as a heavily discounted promotional package. Regrettably, there are no refunds for any unused portion of the package including unused flights. TripADeal cannot offer any refund of monies paid based on these circumstances.

Please note: You may be required to provide a copy of our Terms &amp; Conditions and Refund Policy to your insurer to assist in your claim. This information can be found via the following links:
