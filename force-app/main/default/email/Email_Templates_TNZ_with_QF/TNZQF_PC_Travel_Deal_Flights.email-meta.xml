If you have not already set a password, you can do so here.

*Important: If you make a ‘last minute booking’ within 8 weeks of departure, you must submit your Passenger Information within 24 hours of purchase. These bookings may not receive their final travel documentation until as little as 1 week prior to departure, however they will be fast-tracked to process all visa requirements.

2
Once we’ve got your information, we’ll send you an email to let you know and your booking will be processed.

If you have purchased a tour package without flights included, we will send a follow-up confirmation email once the required minimum numbers for the tour are met and the departure is guaranteed so you may begin to make your own travel arrangements either side of this tour. Please do not make any non-refundable travel arrangements prior to receiving this confirmation.

If you have purchased a tour package with flights included, we suggest you wait until you receive your final travel documentation from TripADeal which will include your flight details before making any non-refundable travel arrangements.

3
We strongly recommend that you purchase travel insurance immediately after making your booking. Your policy should include cancellation, baggage, theft, personal liability, accident and medical cover, plus any other requirements specific to your travel.

4
If travelling overseas, it&apos;s essential you organise all relevant visas prior to travelling. Where a visa is required, you&apos;ll often need to wait till you receive your travel documentation in order to apply for your visa.

TripADeal offers a visa processing service for several of our popular destinations. Advice on how to apply will be provided in your final documentation.

5
You will receive your final travel documentation approximately 4-6 weeks prior to departure (unless otherwise stated in your booking instructions).

We&apos;re here to help you.
